  <p>
    Our interest in this topic came from a search for clean data sets. We discovered two very large data sets recording average rain fall in Minneapolis, 
    and another that records fires responded to by the fire dept. In exploring these two data sets we started to wonder if we could find any trends.
    <ul>
      <li>Can the volume of fire responses per year be affected by rainfall?</li>
      <li>Is there a higher volume of fires during drier years in the city?</li>
      <li>Is there a type of fire response that's more heavily affected by rainfall?</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
